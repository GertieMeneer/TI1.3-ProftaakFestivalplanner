# Major Project "Festival Planner"
Project created by me, https://github.com/Maersel, and https://github.com/Stefsk-glitch.

## Project Description
- This project is a festival planner made using 2D graphics in Java.
- The user is able to create a schedule using the UI. After that, the user can export it, and import it again to view the schedule in the app. When creating a schedule, the user is able to create an artist per performance, who will perform. Artists have properties such as: popularity, name, genre etc.
- In a different tab, the user is able to view the map of the area.
- In the last tab, the user is able to start the simulation.
    - The simulation will draw visitors on the map, entering the festival area. Then, based on the schedule, the visitors will each move to a performance and attend it. Artists with higher popularity will get more visitors. If the performance is finished, the visitors will go back to the main area (toilets, shops etc) waiting for the next performance.
